##  Application Flow

- On launch, the Calmly app displays a minimal home screen with Meditation and Sleep tabs.
- Users select a tab to view sound categories in that context (e.g., Forest, Rain, White Noise).
- Tapping a sound card starts seamless, looped playback‚Äîthe app ensures only one sound plays at a time.
- Users control playback via play/pause on cards or a persistent notification with media controls.
- A timer can be set to auto-stop playback.
- The app remembers the last played sound, restoring it on restart for a consistent, user-friendly experience.
